# Voice & Tone

## Voice

As the expression of my proffesional personality my voice should be dry and simple. To prevent seeming mean or disinterested it can lean more to friendly in some cases.

1. My voice is simple and matter of fact.
2. Bland without use of humor
3. Informative without evoking any kind of strong emotion
4. Is more informal and friendly when it isn't crucial for the reader to pay attention ( introductions etc.)

## Tone

Tone should be straight-forward and informational

- When talking about topics outside of design and work, the language is simple, using more conversational than formal language.
- When discusing work, provide context, but avoid being overly descriptive or emotionally colored, let the reader make their own conclusions.

## Style
- Using short sentences that create text you can quickly navigate
- Don't use acronyms and abbreviations without them being introduced first
- Use common contractions where possible
- Use short sentences and simple language
